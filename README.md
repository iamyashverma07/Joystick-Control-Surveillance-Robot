# Joystick-Control-Surveillance-Robot

This repository contains the design and implementation details of a joystick-controlled surveillance robot. The robot is powered by an Arduino Nano and uses various components such as a joystick, DC motors, a Bluetooth module, and a battery. The system allows for remote control of the robot's movement and surveillance functions.
<br>

<b>Components Used</b>
<br>
<b>Arduino Nano:</b> Microcontroller used to control the robot.
<br>
<b>Joystick Module:</b> Used for manual control of the robot.
<br>
<b>Bluetooth Module:</b> Enables wireless communication between the joystick controller and the robot.
<br>
<b>DC Motors:</b> Provide movement for the robot.
<br>
