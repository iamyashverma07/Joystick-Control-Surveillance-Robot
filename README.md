# Joystick-Control-Surveillance-Robot

This repository contains the design and implementation details of a joystick-controlled surveillance robot. The robot is powered by an Arduino Nano and uses various components such as a joystick, DC motors, a Bluetooth module, and a battery. The system allows for remote control of the robot's movement and surveillance functions.<br>

<b>Components Used</b><br>
Arduino Nano: Microcontroller used to control the robot.<br>
Joystick Module: Used for manual control of the robot.<br>
Bluetooth Module: Enables wireless communication between the joystick controller and the robot.<br>
DC Motors: Provide movement for the robot.<br>
Motor Driver: Controls the speed and direction of the DC motors.<br>
Battery: Powers the entire system.<br>
Wheels and Chassis: Mechanical structure for movement.<br><br>
Features
Wireless Control: The robot can be controlled wirelessly via Bluetooth using a joystick module.<br>
Real-Time Movement: The joystick allows for real-time control of the robot's direction and speed.<br>
Surveillance Capability: The robot can be equipped with a camera or sensors for surveillance purposes.<br><br>
